## Instructions


Your task is to implement the methods as defined in the doc strings
located in the folder `./doc_strings`. 

All of your implementation should occur in 

`./src/__init__.py`

You should then submit your file in the src folder as your solution.
          

## CI Pipeline

Note: if your CI pipeline does not run when you commit, please ensure you have made a merge request to merge
your branch into the primary branch. This will trigger the rules for the CI Job configured for this item.

## Testing Locally

You can test your submission locally by running the 
following command from the root of the exercise folder

```
python3 tests/__init__.py
```
